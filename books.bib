  abstract = {This compact and easy-to-read book contains essential advice on how to take a manuscript from planning right through to publication. It will help both first-time writers and more experienced authors to present their results more effectively. While retaining the easy-to-read and well-structured approach of previous editions, the third edition of this essential guide has been expanded to include comprehensive advice on drawing graphs, and information about Open Access publishing. Illustrations are discussed in detail, with examples of poor illustrations taken from real papers in top-ranked journals, redrawn for comparison. Such before-and-after examples are also provided to demonstrate good and bad writing styles. The reader is offered practical advice - from how to present a paper and where to submit the manuscript, through to responding to reviewers' comments and correcting the proofs - all developed through the author's extensive teaching experience and his many years spent working as a journal editor.},

  abstract = {This book presents direct and concise explanations and examples to many LaTeX syntax and structures, allowing students and researchers to quickly understand the basics that are required for writing and preparing book manuscripts, journal articles, reports, presentation slides and academic theses and dissertations for publication. Unlike much of the literature currently available on LaTeX, which takes a more technical stance, focusing on the details of the software itself, this book presents a user-focused guide that is concerned with its application to everyday tasks and scenarios. It is packed with exercises and looks at topics like formatting text, drawing and inserting tables and figures, bibliographies and indexes, equations, slides, and provides valuable explanations to error and warning messages so you can get work done with the least time and effort needed. This means LaTeX in 24 Hours can be used by students and researchers with little or no previous experience with LaTeX to gain quick and noticeable results, as well as being used as a quick reference guide for those more experienced who want to refresh their knowledge on the subject.},

Several resources exist for individual pieces of this data science stack, but only with the Python Data Science Handbook do you get them all\textemdash IPython, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and other related tools.Working scientists and data crunchers familiar with reading and writing Python code will find this comprehensive desk reference ideal for tackling day-to-day issues: manipulating, transforming, and cleaning data; visualizing different types of data; and using data to build statistical or machine learning models. Quite simply, this is the must-have reference for scientific computing in Python.With this handbook, you'll learn how to use:IPython and Jupyter: provide computational environments for data scientists using PythonNumPy: includes the ndarray for efficient storage and manipulation of dense data arrays in PythonPandas: features the DataFrame for efficient storage and manipulation of labeled/columnar data in PythonMatplotlib: includes capabilities for a flexible range of data visualizations in PythonScikit-Learn: for efficient and clean Python implementations of the most important and established machine learning algorithms},
